		<p><h3>Hi, I'm Kenji Prahyudi!</h3></p>
		<p>There's so much to tell yet too random to write...</p>
		<p>I'm a full-time programmer, a music lover, and a hardcore thinker. I like philoshophy, psychology, cat, basically anything that move us closer to reality.</p>
		<p>Sometimes I arrange some tabs of songs I really like for my own. Then based on some of your requests, I decided to publish a simple personal web page to share my self-arranged guitar tabs. Feel free to use this tabs, but please, credit me.</p>
		<p>I'm not a writer. But sometimes, I had some thought and wrote it down. Most of the time, I lost the points in the middle of my writing. The writing had become a result of a train of thought that doesn't have a really good-quality chain connecting the wagons. But sometimes, I managed to be a quite good machinist and didn't mess my writing up, so it has an acceptable flow and some all-right points.</p>
